# IOS-XE Telemetry

The `IOSXETelemetry` CRD declares MDT-over-gNMI subscriptions for one
`CiscoDevice` and converts them into OpenTelemetry signals.

## Phase 1 — Subscription lifecycle

- `IOSXETelemetry` CRD: create, update, delete, status reporting
- Per-device subscriber in the `cvk-<device>` pod
- Dedicated gNMI `Subscribe` client connection (separate from the config
  driver's gNMI conn)
- STREAM subscriptions with `SAMPLE`, `ON_CHANGE`, or `TARGET_DEFINED`
  stream modes
- Multiplexing compatible subscriptions into one gNMI Subscribe RPC per
  `(encoding, sampleInterval)` bucket
- Bounded notification buffering with `buffer_overflow` drops counted in
  status
- Reconnect with exponential backoff (spec.reconnect)
- Per-stream `Path.Origin` populated from path syntax (first element's
  YANG-module prefix) or the explicit `subscriptions[].origin` field
- `subscriptions[].preservePathPrefix` keeps the module prefix on the first
  `PathElem.Name` instead of lifting it into `Path.Origin`. Required for
  IOS-XE native YANG paths because IOS-XE gnxi rejects `Cisco-IOS-XE-*`
  values as `Path.Origin` and instead expects RFC 7951-style
  module-qualified element names. Leave unset for OpenConfig paths.

  | Path style | spec.subscriptions[] |
  |---|---|
  | OpenConfig | `paths: ["/interfaces/interface/state"]` and `origin: openconfig` |
  | IOS-XE native | `paths: ["/Cisco-IOS-XE-app-hosting-oper:app-hosting-oper-data/apps"]` and `preservePathPrefix: true` |

## Phase 2 — Mapper, log emission, and OTel provider stack

Phase 2 adds the data path that turns each gNMI notification into an
OpenTelemetry record. Phase 2 shipped logs; Phase 3 extends the same
mapper output to metrics.

### Mapper

`internal/telemetry/mapper` is a pure library. It converts raw
`*gpb.Notification` values into `MappedEvent`s ready for emission, with
zero side effects:

- `FlattenPath` joins `prefix + path` and preserves the wire order of
  `PathElem` keys (no re-sorting)
- `Filter` runs in two stages: `wirePath` allow/deny on raw flattened
  paths (load-shed before alias); `metricName` allow/deny on the
  user-facing emitted name (semantic filtering after alias)
- `AliasResolver` matches longest-prefix-wins
- `ResourceAttrExtractor` reads pinned leaves into resource attributes
- `SeriesKeyCache` enforces `cardinalityLimits.maxSeriesPerSubscription`
  with `dropNewSeries` semantics (existing series keep flowing; new
  series after the cap are suppressed and counted into
  `droppedEvents.cardinality_limit`)
- Severity inference for log bodies: `UP`/`ESTABLISHED` → INFO, `DOWN`
  → WARN, `critical`/`error` → ERROR
- Timestamp policy honors `timestamps.useCollectorTimestamp`
  (default true): collector wall clock on the OTel record, device
  timestamp on `cisco.device.timestamp`

The mapper has no implicit driver dependency and is importable as a
standalone package — a future OpenTelemetry Collector receiver can
consume it directly.

### Logs emitter

`internal/telemetry/emit` writes OTel `LogRecord`s for:

- string/ASCII leaves (the body becomes the leaf value)
- `Delete` notifications (body: `deleted: <path>`, severity Info)

Per-record attributes carry the canonicalized `PathElem` keys.

### Three-provider OTel stack

`internal/otelproviders` constructs `TracerProvider`, `MeterProvider`,
and `LoggerProvider` over a single OTLP gRPC connection. Endpoint and
TLS are read from the standard SDK environment:

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (e.g. `otelcol.observability:4317`)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=true` to disable TLS

Phase 2 wires `Providers.Logger` to the `IOSXETelemetryReconciler` so
each subscriber emits log records via the shared exporter.

When `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is unset the providers are nil and
the emitters fall back to noop providers (no records leave the process).

### Status surface

`status.observedSubscriptionState[].logRecordsEmitted` reports the
running count of OTel log records emitted for that subscription.

## Phase 3 — Metrics GA

Phase 3 emits numeric MDT leaves as OpenTelemetry metrics. The mapper
creates `MappedEvent{Signal: metrics}` for `IntVal`, `UintVal`,
`FloatVal`, `DoubleVal`, `DecimalVal`, and JSON/JSON-IETF values whose
root value is numeric.

### Metric classifier

The reconciler builds the classifier chain per `IOSXETelemetry` CR:

```text
OverrideClassifier(spec.mapping.metricTypeOverrides, CuratedClassifier())
```

`metricTypeOverrides` use longest-prefix-wins matching, so operators can
pin a subtree to `gauge` or `sum` without waiting for curated defaults.
The curated classifier marks well-known monotonic counters as `sum`,
including OpenConfig interface counters, IOS-XE interface statistics,
BGP message counters, TCP/UDP packet counters, and app-hosting network
counters. CPU, memory, temperature, power, and PoE readings are gauges.
Unknown numeric paths default to gauge.

### Metrics emitter

`MetricsEmitter` records:

- `gauge` events with OTel `Float64Gauge.Record`
- `sum` events with OTel `Float64Counter.Add`

gNMI counters arrive as cumulative values. The emitter stores the last
value per series key and emits only the positive delta. If the current
value is lower than the previous value, the emitter treats it as a
counter reset, records `cisco_vk_telemetry_counter_resets_total`, stores
the new baseline, and skips the negative point.

The mapper also tracks a `StartTimestamp` per `(streamEpoch, seriesKey)`.
Each new Subscribe RPC gets a fresh stream epoch, so downstream consumers
can distinguish counter segments after stream restarts.

### Self metrics

The metrics path registers these counters on `Providers.Meter`:

- `cisco_vk_telemetry_metric_points_emitted_total`
  (`device`, `subscription`, `kind`)
- `cisco_vk_telemetry_classifier_decisions_total`
  (`device`, `subscription`, `kind`)
- `cisco_vk_telemetry_counter_resets_total`
  (`device`, `subscription`, `metric`)

`status.observedSubscriptionState[].metricPointsEmitted` and
`GET /telemetry/health` report metric points emitted per subscription.

## Phase 4 — YANG classification and transition traces

Phase 4 adds optional YANG-driven metric classification, recovery spans
for watched state transitions, and a shared trace provider path for
topology spans.

### YANG-driven classification

When `YANG_MODELS_DIR` points at a directory of `.yang` files, the
`cvk-<device>` process loads those modules once and compiles resolved
leaf types into the metric classifier chain:

```text
OverrideClassifier(
  spec.mapping.metricTypeOverrides,
  YangClassifier(yangRegistry, fallback: CuratedClassifier()),
)
```

The YANG loader resolves typedefs, imports, groupings, uses, leaves,
leaf-lists, containers, and lists. Types named `counter32` or
`counter64` classify as `sum`; integer, unsigned integer, decimal64,
string, and enumeration leaves classify as `gauge`. Unknown or
unresolved paths fall through to the curated classifier, so users
without `YANG_MODELS_DIR` keep the Phase 3 behavior.

YANG lookups are memoized in a bounded registry cache. The default cap
is 4096 compiled `(module, leafPath)` lookups; on cap hit, the cache
resets all entries rather than doing per-entry LRU eviction.

### State-transition spans

`spec.mapping.transitions` declares state leaves to watch. The mapper
emits trace candidate events for those paths when `output.signal`
includes `traces`. The `TracesEmitter` tracks each `(path, key-set)`
independently:

- healthy → unhealthy records the observation timestamp
- unhealthy → healthy emits a span from the latest unhealthy
  observation to the healthy observation
- healthy-only observations do not emit spans

Recovery span names use `state.transition.<aliasedName>`. Span
attributes include `from-state`, `to-state`, `duration`,
`cisco.gnmi.path`, and the path keys such as interface `name`.

The emitter also records
`cisco_vk_telemetry_state_transitions_total` on `Providers.Meter` with
`device`, `subscription`, `path`, `from`, and `to` attributes.

### Topology trace consolidation

The topology exporter now accepts a shared `trace.TracerProvider`.
When the MDT telemetry provider stack exists, topology spans use
`otelproviders.Providers.Tracer` and keep their own instrumentation
scope, `cisco-virtual-kubelet/topology`. When no shared provider is
available, the exporter preserves the older behavior and builds its own
per-device OTLP trace provider from `device.otel`.

When topology uses the shared provider, endpoint, TLS, headers, and
shutdown are owned by `internal/otelproviders`; topology-specific data
remains on span attributes and scope name rather than a separate
topology-only resource.
