# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to diagnose them.

## First — gather the basics

The Helm release name is `cvk` throughout this page (matching the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide). If you installed with a different release name, substitute it wherever `cvk` appears below.

```bash
# CiscoDevice full state — usually the most useful starting point
kubectl describe ciscodevice <name>
kubectl get ciscodevice <name> -o yaml

# Controller logs
kubectl -n cvk-system logs deploy/cvk-controller --tail=200

# VK pod logs (one per device)
kubectl -n <device-namespace> logs deploy/<device-name>-vk --tail=200

# Virtual node status
kubectl describe node <device-name>

# Pods on the virtual node
kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=<device-name>
```

On the device:

```
show iox-service
show app-hosting list
show app-hosting detail appid <app-id>
```

## CiscoDevice stuck in `Provisioning`

`Provisioning` means the controller has created the ConfigMap and Deployment but no VK pod is Ready yet.

**Check the VK Deployment:**

```bash
kubectl get deploy <device-name>-vk -o yaml
kubectl describe pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cisco-vk,app.kubernetes.io/instance=<device-name>
```

**Common causes:**

- **Image pull error** — make sure `image.repository`/`vkImage.repository` points at a registry the cluster can pull from.
- **Bad credentials** — look for `401 Unauthorized` in VK pod logs. Verify the Secret key is spelled `password` (not `PASSWORD`, not `pass`).
- **Device unreachable** — look for `dial tcp: i/o timeout` in VK pod logs. Check routing, firewall, and that RESTCONF is enabled (`restconf` in device config).
- **TLS verification failing** — look for `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`. Either supply `tls.caFile`, or temporarily set `tls.insecureSkipVerify: true` to confirm.

---

## Pod stuck in `Pending`

`Pending` means the VK has accepted the pod but the device has not yet reached `RUNNING`.

**Walk the state machine.** Check VK logs for the reconcile line:

```
ReconcileApp cvk00000_<uid>: observed="INSTALLING" desired=Running phase=Converging
```

Known intermediate states that are expected:

- `INSTALLING` — normal during the first 5–30 seconds.
- `DEPLOYED` — very brief; VK will issue `activate` on the next poll.
- `ACTIVATED` — very brief; VK will issue `start` on the next poll.

If the pod stays in the same state for more than a minute, there is something wrong. See specific sections below.

---

## PackagePolicyInvalid false positives

### Symptom

Pod shows `Failed` with:

```
status:
  phase: Failed
  reason: PackagePolicyInvalid
  message: "install blocked: app package policy is invalid ..."
```

### Why it happens

IOS-XE reports `pkg-policy = iox-pkg-policy-invalid` as the YANG default during the first 1–3 seconds of every install, before signature verification completes. A confirming install notification only appears when the device actually rejects the package. The reconciler tries to distinguish the two by waiting for the notification, but if the notification ordering is off or the device never emits one, you can get stuck.

### Fix

If you're running unsigned packages on purpose — your own custom application builds, or a device that doesn't enforce signed-verification:

```yaml
spec:
  allowUnsignedApps: true
```

This tells the reconciler to skip the pkg-policy check entirely during INSTALLING.

If you want signing enforced:

1. Verify the package is actually signed (`show app-hosting detail appid <id>` → `Signature verified: YES`).
2. If the package is signed but the check is firing, check logs for the full notification text — the device explains what failed:
   ```
   kubectl logs deploy/<device-name>-vk | grep "install blocked"
   ```

The pod recovery loop will automatically retry these failed pods with exponential backoff; you don't need to `kubectl delete` them.

## Pod never gets an IP (shows `0.0.0.0`)

IP discovery runs in two stages. If both come up empty the pod stays at `0.0.0.0`.

**1. Oper-data path**

```bash
# On the device
show app-hosting detail appid <app-id> | include ipv4
```

If the oper-data shows a real IP but the pod doesn't, the VK isn't scraping it — check VK logs for errors calling `app-hosting-oper-data`.

**2. ARP fallback**

```
show arp
```

If the container's MAC appears but the IP is still `0.0.0.0` at the pod, the VK's ARP lookup is failing. Most common cause: the MAC in oper-data doesn't match the ARP entry because the container hasn't finished DHCP handshake yet. Give it 30 s; the reconciler will retry.

**If no ARP entry exists at all:**

- DHCP pool is misconfigured (wrong network, exhausted pool).
- VirtualPortGroup interface is down or has no IP.
- App-hosting does not have the `guest-ipaddress` fields populated (check `show app-hosting list detailed`).

---

## `kubectl top node` returns an error

```
error: Metrics not available for node <name>
```

Verify the stats endpoint is reachable:

```bash
kubectl get --raw "/api/v1/nodes/<name>/proxy/stats/summary" | head
```

If that works but `kubectl top` fails, the metrics-server does not trust the kubelet certificate. On k3s:

```
# /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml
kubelet-certificate-authority: ""
```

On upstream Kubernetes, either supply a signed kubelet cert via `--tls-cert-file` / `--tls-key-file`, or add `--kubelet-insecure-tls` to the metrics-server deployment.

---

## Prometheus metrics missing

`cisco_device_*` metrics are served from the VK pod's kubelet endpoint (`/metrics/resource`).

Expected setup: your Prometheus is already scraping kubelets (`kube-prometheus-stack` does this by default).

**Check:**

```bash
# Are the metrics there at all?
kubectl get --raw "/api/v1/nodes/<name>/proxy/metrics/resource" | grep cisco_device
```

**If the raw endpoint returns metrics but Prometheus doesn't see them:**

- The node ServiceMonitor isn't matching (check labels).
- The scrape job for kubelets doesn't use the `/metrics/resource` path — some configurations only scrape `/metrics/cadvisor`.

**If the raw endpoint returns only `cisco_device_cpu_*`/`memory_*`/`storage_*` but no `interface_*` or `cdp_*`:**

- The driver does not implement `TopologyProvider`. This is always the case for the FAKE driver and will be the case for future drivers that don't implement topology.
- Or the device has no CDP/OSPF neighbors to report.

---

## OTEL traces not appearing

**Check it's enabled:**

```bash
kubectl get ciscodevice <name> -o yaml | yq .spec.otel
```

**Verify VK pod startup:**

```bash
kubectl logs deploy/<device-name>-vk | grep -i otel
```

You should see one of:

- `OTEL topology exporter started` — good, emitting
- `Failed to initialise OTEL topology exporter` — endpoint unreachable or config invalid
- `driver does not implement TopologyProvider` — wrong driver (FAKE doesn't, XE does)

**Common misconfigurations:**

- `endpoint` has scheme prefix (wrong): `https://otel:4317`. Use `host:port` only.
- `insecure: false` against a plaintext gRPC collector — use `insecure: true` for typical in-cluster OTLP collectors without TLS.
- `intervalSecs` set below 10 — the minimum is enforced to 10 s; values below will silently use 60 s.

**No traces after 60 s**: check the collector logs — it will receive spans in batches. Splunk Observability Cloud can sometimes take a minute to surface the first trace.

---

## Pod stuck `Failed` forever

Usually one of:

- `reason: NotFound` — VK pod was restarted and lost state. The pod recovery loop handles this automatically.
- `reason: ProviderFailed` — transient device issue. Recovery loop handles this.
- `reason: PackagePolicyInvalid` — see [above](#packagepolicyinvalid-false-positives).

The pod recovery loop resets matching Failed pods to `Pending` with exponential backoff (15 s → 5 min). You should see this in VK logs:

```
Recovered <n> stale failed pods
```

If the loop isn't running, check the VK pod is healthy (not crash-looping). The recovery goroutine starts with the rest of the VK and stops when the VK exits.

---

## Virtual node lingers after `CiscoDevice` deletion

Normally the controller deletes the virtual `Node` as part of finalizer cleanup. If you see a lingering node:

```bash
kubectl get node <device-name>
# Status: NotReady
```

This usually means the finalizer was skipped (force-delete of the CR, or the controller was down when deletion happened). Clean up by hand:

```bash
kubectl delete node <device-name>
```

Check no orphaned Deployment / ConfigMap remains:

```bash
kubectl -n <ns> get deploy,cm | grep <device-name>
```

Avoid `kubectl delete ciscodevice --force --grace-period=0` — it skips the finalizer and will cause this.

---

## `kubectl rollout restart` did not pick up a new password

The controller only rotates the pod when the **ConfigMap** changes (via the `cisco.vk/config-hash` annotation on the pod template). A password change on the referenced Secret alone does not trigger a rollout. Force one manually:

```bash
kubectl -n <ns> rollout restart deploy/<device-name>-vk
```

## Where to look next

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) — internal state machines and data flow
- [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) — every field and its defaults
- [Observability](observability.md) — metrics and OTEL details
- GitHub issues — if your problem isn't listed here, file an issue with:
  - CiscoDevice spec (redact credentials)
  - `kubectl describe ciscodevice` output
  - VK pod logs (`--tail=200`)
  - `show app-hosting detail appid <id>` from the device
